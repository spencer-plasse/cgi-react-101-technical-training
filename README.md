src/
   components/ - Custom components (including App and the navbar)
   pages/ - Custom pages with associated React Router routes in the App component
   redux/ - Store, root reducer, and two slices
   styles/ - A couple of small stylesheets for minor things
   tests/ - Unit and "integration" tests using DOM Testing Library and React Testing Library. I struggled very badly to get some of these working and multiple sill fail (as well as there not being a test for the Register page). When grading, I am open to feedback and assistance on getting these to work but I am at my wit's end trying to make them work myself.
   utils/ - Utility functions and constants
